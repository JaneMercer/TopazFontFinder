# TopazFontFinder
Font finder app.

2020 upd: I find this method to be pretty ineficient, but back then I had very limited time to finish the task, so I decided to go with the simpliest solution.
Actualy I would firstly analize the database of fonts, creating somewhat of a information structure with font clusters sorted by common features. 
So it wouldn't be neccecary to compare each existing font with the clients example. Instead extract features from client examples and try to find the coresponding cluster in a database.
New added fonts would also go through the sorting process.
