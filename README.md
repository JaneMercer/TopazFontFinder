# TopazFontFinder
Font finder app.

2020 upd: I find this method outdated, but I needed a simple solution. Actually, if I had more resources, I would firstly analize the database of fonts, creating somewhat of a information structure with font clusters sorted by common features. So it wouldn't be necessary to compare each existing font with the clients' example. Instead, extract features from client examples and try to find the corresponding cluster in a database. New added fonts would also go through the sorting process.
